#### Objective

Build an AI-powered system to help employees request purchases and travel reimbursements. The system should check company rules, reduce manual work, and make approvals, payments, and notifications faster and easier.

#### Scope of Work

1. **Workflow Design**:

   - **Budget Submission**:
     - Employees fill out a simple form (web, mobile, or chatbot) to submit their estimated budget for purchases or travel.
   - **Compliance Check**:
     - The form application collects key info (amount, reason, dates, category) and checks if it follows company rules (like spending limits).
     - The AI compares the request with company rules stored in a simple rule system.
     - If something is wrong, the employee gets a clear message about what needs fixing.
   - **Approval Process**:
     - If the request is OK, it goes to the employee's manager for approval (via email, Slack, or app).
     - If the amount is over $2,000, the CEO also needs to approve.
     - All decisions are recorded, and employees are told the result.
   - **Advance Request**:
     - Once approved, the AI creates an advance payment request in the finance system and tells the finance team.
   - **Invoice Submission and Reimbursement**:
     - After the purchase or trip, employees upload invoices using the same interface.
     - The AI checks if the invoices match the approved budget.
     - If everything is fine, reimbursement is approved and processed, and the employee is notified.
     - If not, the employee is asked to clarify or resubmit.
   - **Audit and Reporting**:
     - The AI keeps a record of all actions for audits.
     - It creates simple reports for finance and management (like monthly spending).
2. **Key Features**:

   - Use AI to read and understand forms and invoices (NLP and OCR).
   - Simple rule engine for checking company policies.
   - Connect to existing systems (finance, HR) using APIs.
   - Send real-time notifications (email, Slack, or app).
   - Keep a full log for transparency.
   - Handle many requests at once.
3. **Deliverables**:

   - Working AI system for purchase and travel requests.
   - User interface (web, mobile, or chatbot).
   - Integration with company systems (like SAP, QuickBooks).
   - Documentation (user guide, technical docs).
   - Training for users and admins.

#### Recommended Tools

1. **AI and Automation**:

   - **Microsoft Power Automate**: For automating workflows and connecting with Office 365.
   - **Google Cloud AI, AWS AI Services, Microsoft Azure AI, GPT API, or open-source tools like Tesseract OCR and spaCy**: For reading forms and invoices (NLP, OCR).
2. **Integration and Backend**:

   - **Zapier or n8n or Apache Airflow**: For connecting different systems easily.
   - **Node.js or Python (FastAPI)**: For backend logic and APIs.
   - **PostgreSQL**: For storing logs and policies.
3. **User Interface**:

   - **React**: For a simple web app.
   - **Slack or Microsoft Teams**: For notifications and approvals.
4. **Policy Management**:

   - **Simple rule engine** like JSON-based rules or a lightweight library. 

#### Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Design (2 weeks)**:

   - Talk to HR, finance, and managers to get requirements.
   - Write down company rules and approval steps.
   - Draw simple workflow diagrams.
   - Choose tools and tech stack.
2. **Phase 2: Development (4-6 weeks)**:

   - Build the AI system:
     - Add form reading and invoice checking.
     - Set up rule checks.
     - Add approval routing (manager, CEO if needed).
   - Build the user interface.
   - Connect to finance and HR systems.
   - Set up notifications.
3. **Phase 3: Testing and Training (2 weeks)**:

   - Test all parts of the system.
   - Try different scenarios (correct and incorrect requests).
   - Train users and admins.
   - Improve based on feedback.
4. **Phase 4: Deployment and Support (Ongoing)**:

   - Launch the system.
   - Monitor and fix issues.
   - Update as needed (like rule changes).

#### Assumptions

- Company systems have APIs.
- Company rules are clear and can be put into simple rules.
- Employees can use digital devices.

#### Risks and Mitigation

- **Integration issues**: Use Zapier or simple APIs; test well.
- **Frequent rule changes**: Use a flexible, easy-to-update rule system.
- **Low employee adoption**: Provide training and make the interface easy to use.

#### Estimated Timeline

- Total: 8-10 weeks (depending on integration needs).

#### Success Metrics

- 90% less manual work for approvals and reimbursements.
- 95% accuracy in checking rules and invoices.
- 80% employee satisfaction (survey).
- Full audit trail with no missing records.
